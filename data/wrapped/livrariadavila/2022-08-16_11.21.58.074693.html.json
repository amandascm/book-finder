 "info": "I called his name, settled on a bench, was amazed I felt really, really happy. Four people enter a park, and through their eyes we see four different visions. There´s the bossy woman, the sad man, the lonely boy and the young girl whose warmth touches those she meets. As the story moves from one voice to another, their perspectives are reflected in the shifting landscape and seasons. This is an intriguing, many-layered, enormously entertaining book that demands to be read again and again.",
