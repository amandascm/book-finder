He puts on his new shirt, pants, shoes, and tie, and is immediately transformed from the scruffiest giant in town to the spiffiest giant in town. But on his way home, George runs into various animals who need his help. And little by little, George finds himself giving away all his new purchases. \nFrom the creators of Room on the Broom, this is a lively tale that reminds readers that sometimes it´s what´s inside a person-or a giant-that matters most",
