A new generation of politicized artists, designers and communicators the world over are using stencil art as an accessible yet powerful means of giving voice to their ideas. The Stencil Graffiti Handbook sees Tristan Manco back on the streets. Through an incomparable network of street-art contacts, gained through over two decades of immersion in the scene, Manco has scoured the globe to find the most interesting street artists working today – those operating outside of the mainstream market of ‘Urban Art’ and beneath the radar of everyone but the true cognoscenti.",
