His colorfully luminescent paintings are a sweeping affirmation of joie - de - vivre, levity and sensitivity. Featuring well - researched texts and numerous illustrations, this volume offers fascinating insights into the life and artistic development of Henri Matisse Henri Matisse, one of the preeminent pioneers of modern art. When people think of Matisse’s art, they tend to remember above all the famous cut - o uts from the last years of his life. He created these at a time when he was already confined to his bed and traded his brush for scissors. In the new volume of the The Great Masters of Art series, Markus Müller knowledgeably and vividly describes how Matis se’s artistic oeuvre developed towards these color - intensive and near - abstract works. An illustrated biography, as well as archive finds the author was able to include thanks to his close connection to the artist’s estate, present Matisse as an artist whos e works are a feast of colors and forms.",
