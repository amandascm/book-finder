From Japanese photographer Daido Moriyama, famous for his images of post-war Japan, to Richard Mosse, an Irish conceptual documentarian who uses infrared film to document war in the Eastern Congo from a bold new perspective, this book offers an exciting array of familiar and not-so-familiar works. Among the photographers included are Nan Goldin, William Eggleston, Sebastia o Salgado, Sally Mann, Nobuyoshi Araki, Dayanita Singh, Juergen Teller, and Alec Soth.
